# AVR Docker Image

This image is intended for people who want to develop code for the Atmel AVR
family of microcontrollers, but don't want to install the Arduino IDE.

## Using For Your Own Projects

You should modiffy the launch-devimage.bat script to use your local directory.

You may also want to modify scripts to change the image name, so that they
match your project.  That way you can keep any local customizations isolated to
their target project.
